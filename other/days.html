         We just got loaded in Chicago, secured the load, did pre-trip inspection (PTI),<br>(important step, loaded truck weights up to 80,000 pounds, so safety is always priority) and now we are ready to roll.<br> It's late morning, so we have almost all day for driving!
     </p>
     <p>
         After getting on I-80 and driving for 2.5 hours we are entering Iowa
     </p>

    <p>
         Already afternoon, so we are stopping for half an hour at a truck stop for food and restroom,<br> also checking our load securement, then back on the road!
         <br>
         3.5 hours later we are entering Nebraska:

    <p>
         Half an hour later another stop to get fuel and food. <br>
         on average truck burns 100 gallons of diesel a day,<br>
         But no worries it takes just about 10 min to fill it up!<br>
         After truck and we filled up, time to get back on a road!<br>
    </p>
    <p>
         After another hour and a half of driving we are stopping in York for the night!<br> Time for shower and rest. Legally, a solo driver can drive only 11 hours a day in 14 hours<br>(3 hours are for stops, loading/unloading and other stuff).<br> After 14 hours a driver supposed to get at least 10 hours of "sleeper" (rest) time.
